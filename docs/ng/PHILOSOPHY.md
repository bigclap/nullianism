## Di Highest Value — To Sabi di World

Our highest value na to sabi di world. Di better we sabi di world wey dey around us, di more we fit achieve our goals, no matter wetin dem be. From dis value, humanism dey follow: human life na di main value, because death dey deny person di chance to sabi.

## Di Foundation — Scientific Approach

Unlike traditional religions wey dey based on belief, nullianism dey based on doubt, critical thinking, and scientific method. We no dey accept claims without evidence.

## Attitude Towards God and Supernatural

For nullianism, God no dey, because science never discover am. E be like atheistic religion. We no dey claim say God no dey at all, but we dey act based on di absence of convincing evidence of im existence. If dem fit prove say deity dey scientifically, nullianism go accept dat fact.

## Life After Death: Immortalism

Instead of belief in life after death, nullianism dey propose di idea of **immortalism** — di pursuit to prevent or delay physical death as much as possible with science and technology. We no dey prepare for death, but we dey try avoid am. Nullianist dey give consent by default for technological immortality and resurrection, if dat kind opportunity show for future.

## Enemies of Nullianism

Di main antagonist of nullianism na **anti-argumentation**:

- Deliberate spread of misinformation.
- Disrespectful attitude towards science and facts.
- Settling disputes with force instead of logic and arguments.
- Appealing to emotions instead of reason.

We no dey fight people, but harmful ideas.
