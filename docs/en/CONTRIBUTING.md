# How to Contribute

Nullianism is an open-source religion. Everyone can contribute to its development.

## How to do it?

1. **Suggest ideas through Issues:** If you have a proposal for a new commandment, ritual, clarification of philosophy, or just a thought for discussion, create a new Issue in this repository.
2. **Make edits through Pull Requests:** If you want to correct a typo, improve wording, or add something specific to existing files, fork the repository, make changes, and submit a Pull Request.

## Core Principles

- **Alignment with philosophy:** All proposals must align with the key values of Nullianism: curiosity, scientific approach, critical thinking, and humanism.
- **Constructiveness:** Discussions must be respectful. We critique ideas, not people.
- **Absence of dogma:** Nullianism is a living, evolving system. Be prepared for your ideas to be challenged, and be open to changing them in light of new facts and arguments.

Let's create the religion of the future together!
