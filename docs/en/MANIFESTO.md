# Manifesto of Curiosity

For too long, humanity has been divided by dogmas, blinded by uncritical beliefs, and restrained by inherited "truths." But within every human mind, there is a fire — a desire to ask questions, explore, and seek truth beyond traditions.

We are the heirs of a great path of thinkers — from the first astronomers who mapped the stars to modern scientists uncovering the mysteries of the universe.

We stand on the threshold of a new era. The world no longer needs faith in the unknowable — it needs a commitment to the knowable, the provable, and the possible. It is time to forge a new path, where curiosity is sacred, reason is revered, and knowledge is the guiding star.

- **Knowledge is a moral duty.** To learn is to liberate oneself, to teach is to liberate others.
- **The dissemination of knowledge is the highest ethical act.**
- **Doubt is sacred.** Questions do not weaken us; they make us stronger. If a belief cannot withstand scrutiny, it is unworthy of retention.
- **The universe is our temple.** We are in awe not of the supernatural, but of the grandeur of the cosmos and the complexity of nature.
- **Progress is above tradition.** The past can serve as a guide, but not as chains. If new knowledge disproves old beliefs, we embrace the new.
- **We are a community of Seekers.** No one walks the path alone. We commit to supporting each other in the search for truth, sharing ideas, debating, and refining them.
- **This is not just a philosophy — it is a movement.** We strive not only to think differently but to change the world.

The future belongs to the seekers, not the submissive.
The era of blind faith is over.
The era of Curiosity begins now.

You need no baptism, blessing, or permission. All that is required is the courage to ask: What else can I learn?
