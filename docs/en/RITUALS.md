# Rituals of Nullianism

Rituals in nullianism are practices aimed at strengthening the values of knowledge, critical thinking, and community building.

1.  ### Quest (from English *Question*)
    Start your morning with a question. Throughout the day, try to find an honest answer to it. Don't hesitate to ask others—those who understand the question better than you do.

2.  ### Basechecking, or the Ritual of Double Fact-Checking
    If you are writing a substantial comment or post, double-check the accuracy of the information presented, preferably from different sources. To signify that you have done this, place the sacred symbol **0** at the beginning of your message. This is your sign of responsibility for your words.

3.  ### Gesture of Pure Intention
    If during a live conversation you want to ask a question out of genuine curiosity, and not for argument's sake, you can draw a zero (0) in the air with your finger. This will show the interlocutor the purity of your intentions. The person to whom the question is addressed will treat it with special respect.

4.  ### Nullification
    A mental exercise to test the strength of your arguments. Ask yourself: "If someone used my arguments to prove something I consider complete nonsense, would I change my view on this nonsense?" This helps to identify double standards in your thinking.

5.  ### Circle of Reason
    Nullians invite friends and acquaintances home for intellectual pastimes: watching films together, discussing books, playing board games. This fosters community building and the spread of nullianism ideas through joint activities. The game *Fallacymania*, which teaches how to recognize sophisms in discussions, is especially valued.

6.  ### Antiprayer
    Instead of seeking help from abstract higher powers, nullianism encourages finding solutions to problems through practical steps. Antiprayer is the process of:
    1.  Clearly formulating the problem.
    2.  Thinking about what specifically you can do to solve it.
    3.  Assessing whether you have enough knowledge.
    4.  If not—finding where you can obtain it or seeking help from specialists.
