# Philosophy of Nullianism

## The Highest Value — Knowledge of the World

Our highest value is the knowledge of the world. The better we understand the surrounding world, the more effectively we can achieve our goals, whatever they may be. From this value stems humanism: human life is the main value, as death deprives a person of the opportunity to learn.

## Foundation — Scientific Approach

Unlike traditional religions based on faith, nullianism is based on doubt, critical thinking, and the scientific method. We do not accept claims without evidence.

## Attitude Towards God and the Supernatural

In nullianism, there is no God because science has not discovered one. It is a functionally atheistic religion. We do not claim that God definitely does not exist, but we act based on the absence of convincing evidence of His existence. If the existence of a deity is scientifically proven, nullianism will accept this fact.

## Life After Death: Immortalism

Instead of believing in an afterlife, nullianism offers the idea of **immortalism** — the pursuit of preventing or significantly delaying physical death through science and technology. We do not prepare for death but strive to avoid it. A nullianist by default consents to technological immortality and resurrection if such an opportunity arises in the future.

## Enemies of Nullianism

The main antagonist of nullianism is **anti-argumentation**:

- Deliberate dissemination of misinformation.
- Disregard for science and facts.
- Resolving disputes through force rather than logic and arguments.
- Appealing to emotions instead of addressing reason.

We fight not against people, but against harmful ideas.
