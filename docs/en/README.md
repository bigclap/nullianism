# Nullianism

> The world's first scientific Open-Source religion.

Welcome to the Nullianism repository — a scientific religion created by Alexander Panchin. This is not a joke or clickbait, but a social experiment and an attempt to create a value system based not on dogmas and faith, but on curiosity, critical thinking, and a scientific approach.

## Main Idea

Nullianism is a religion designed to unite people not around a deity or deities, but around human curiosity. We use the "shell" of religion — its powerful mechanism for spreading ideas and creating communities — but fill it with rational and humanistic content.

**Our symbol is Zero (0)**. It symbolizes:

- The absence of dogmas and prejudices.
- The starting point of knowledge.
- Equidistance of all participants from the center, absence of hierarchy.
- The ring of reason, uniting people.

## Repository Structure

- [**Manifesto of Curiosity (`MANIFESTO.md`)**](./MANIFESTO.md) — the main program text of our religion, generated by artificial intelligence.
- [**Commandments (`COMMANDMENTS.md`)**](./COMMANDMENTS.md) — 8 key principles that guide a Nullian.
- [**Rituals (`RITUALS.md`)**](./RITUALS.md) — practices that help strengthen and spread the ideas of Nullianism.
- [**Philosophy (`PHILOSOPHY.md`)**](./PHILOSOPHY.md) — a detailed exposition of the main values, worldview, ethics, and enemies of Nullianism.
- [**How to Contribute (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)**](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — guidelines for those who want to participate in the development of this religion.
